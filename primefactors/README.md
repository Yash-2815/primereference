# primefactors

This folder contains programs to find the prime factors of a given number.

## Programs
1. **primefactors.java**:
   - Uses a combination of factorization and primality checks.
   - Steps:
     1. Find all factors up to √n.
     2. Check if each factor is prime.
   - Time complexity: O(√n × log(√n)) (for factorization and primality checks).
   - Space complexity: O(k), where k is the number of factors.
2. **primefactors.py**:
   - Implements the same algorithm in Python.
   - Time and space complexities are identical to those of `primefactors.java`.
3. **primefactors.cpp**:
   - Implements the same algorithm in Python.
   - Time and space complexities are identical to those of `primefactors.java`.
