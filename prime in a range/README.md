# prime_number_with_a_range

This folder contains programs to calculate all prime numbers within a given range, using efficient algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Programs
1. **rangeofprimes.java**:
   - Uses a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes to count primes and retrieve primes in a range.
   - Time complexity: O(n log log n) (for sieve initialization).
   - Space complexity: O(n) (for storing prime status).
2. **sievemethod.py**:
   - Python implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding primes.
   - Time and space complexities are identical to those of `rangeofprimes.java`.
3. **SieveMethodForFindingPrimes.java**:
   - Similar to `rangeofprimes.java`, with focus on finding primes up to a maximum number.
   - Time and space complexities are identical.
